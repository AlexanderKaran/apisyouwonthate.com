# Change Log
All notable changes to the book will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Introduction: Expanded to explain that this is not just about REST, but good HTTP APIs in general, and Hypermedia.
- Chapter 4: Added a section to chapter4 about "JSON-API" and "Problem Details" standards for errors.
- Chapter 6: Mentioned "Marshmallow" and "ActiveModel Serializers" as alternatives to Fractal.
- Chapter 9: Mentioned "Doorkeeper" and made the description of `bshaffer/oauth2-server` more fair.

### Removed

- Chapter 4: Deleted the "Error v Errors" section, as I now like Errors and the single error argument was not worth ignoring popular approach.

## 1.5.0 - 2014-11-17

### Added
