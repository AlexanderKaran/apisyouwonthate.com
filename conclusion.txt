# Conclusion

Thank you for reading the whole way through this book. This was a large and 
complex topic which I tried to turn into an interesting read with some humor.

It has been a really enjoyable experience and I have been blown away with the 
positive feedback. I have also received some constructive criticism for which I
am grateful.

I will continue to maintain this book and I have some requests, suggestions and
general ideas for improvements to make. But, if you have read this then the meat 
of the book is now the same as it will always be. 

For example, I plan to;

* Improve the Behat test coverage on the sample application.
* Implement [league\oauth2-server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server) for the PHP sample app.
* Maybe add a chapter on Caching.

I cannot promise when these will be done as the book has already taken a great 
deal of time to get to this point, but if you leave email alerts on I will 
send out updates sparingly. 

# Further Reading

Here are some books that you should consider reading. While are not directly about API development, they are
about related subjects. APIs need to be tested. APIs need virtual machines to run on, and they need 
provisioning tools to keep those virtual machines in check.

[Vagrant CookBook] - Learn how to create effective Vagrant development environments. This book will cover from basic to advanced concepts on Vagrant, including important ProTips to improve your Vagrant projects and avoid common mistakes.

[The Grumpy Programmer's PHPUnit Cookbook] - Learning how to use PHPUnit doesn't have to suck. Your code is untested and fixing bugs is tedious. You know you need something better, but time just doesn't seem to be on your side. Making things "right" is costly and you need to deliver working code NOW.
