# Sample Code

Throughout this book I will refer to source code which exists on a GitHub repo, which can be downloaded in a few ways. 

a) You can clone it:

  git clone git@github.com:philsturgeon/build-apis-you-wont-hate.git

b) Browse around it:

  https://github.com/philsturgeon/build-apis-you-wont-hate

c) Download it as a `.zip` file:

  http://bit.ly/apisyouwonthate-zip

This contains a few bits and bobs that will save you from copying and pasting things out of the ebook, which would probably be horrendous.
