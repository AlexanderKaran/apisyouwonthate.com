# Sample Code

Throughout this book I will refer to source code which exists on a GitHub repo.

a) You can clone it:

~~~~~~~~
$ git clone git@github.com:philsturgeon/build-apis-you-wont-hate.git
~~~~~~~~

b) Browse around it:

> https://github.com/philsturgeon/build-apis-you-wont-hate

c) Download it as a `.zip` file:

> http://bit.ly/apisyouwonthate-zip

This contains a few bits and bobs that will save you from copying and pasting things out of the ebook, which would probably be horrendous.

The book will assume you place the contents in `~/apisyouwonthate`, so if you put it somewhere else update the path in the examples.
