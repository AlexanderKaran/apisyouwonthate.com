# Sample Code

Throughout this book I will refer to source code which exists on a GitHub repo, which can be downloaded in a few ways. You can clone it:

    git clone git@github.com:philsturgeon/build-apis-you-wont-hate.git

Browse around it:

    https://github.com/philsturgeon/build-apis-you-wont-hate

Download it as a `.zip` file:

    http://bit.ly/apisyouwonthate-zip

This contains a few bits and bobs that will save you having to copy and paste things out of the ebook, which would probably be horrendous.
