      %h2 About Phil Sturgeon
      %p I have seen a few trends come and go during my long and varied career of building stuff for money, as an employee, freelancer, consultant and CTO. One of the recent trends is the rise of APIs as an everyday part of the average server-side developers job.

      %p Since 2009 I have built 20+ HTTP APIs, and learned a lot of things the hard way. I have been lucky enough to give multiple talks on APIs at conferences and user groups around the world, sharing this experience with as many developers as will listen.
