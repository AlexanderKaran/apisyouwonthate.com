      %h2 About Phil Sturgeon
      %p Over the last five years I've worked as a consultant, Head of API and CTO for several API-centric technology startups. The most recent, Ride, has given me the chance to work with several amazing developers, including several Rails API contributors. Ride let me share our API experiences at conferences world-wide, which is an amazing opportunity to educate others on a topic I'm incredibly passionate about.

      %p My background in API-world is pretty extensive even before that. I built the CodeIgniter-RestServer, which - whilst far from perfect - was used by Apple, USA.gov, and even the UN at one point. I've been blogging and writing about the topic since 2009, and I plan to keep going!
