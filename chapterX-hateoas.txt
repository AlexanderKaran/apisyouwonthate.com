# HATEOAS {#chapter-7}

1. **“The Swamp of POX.”** You’re using HTTP to make RPC calls. HTTP is only really used as a tunnel.
1. **Resources.** Rather than making every call to a service endpoint, you have multiple endpoints that are used to represent resources, and you’re talking to them. This is the very beginnings of supporting REST.
1. **HTTP Verbs.** This is the level that something like Rails gives you out of the box: You interact with these Resources using HTTP verbs, rather than always using POST.
1. **Hypermedia Controls.** HATEOAS. You’re 100% REST compliant.
