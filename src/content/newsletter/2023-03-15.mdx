## Intro

APIs You Won't Hate is back with a new monthly newsletter. We'll share news, updates, and more on all things APIs. Along with some of our favourite articles and resources from the past month.

If you're wondering why you're getting this email, you signed up for our newsletters at some point. It's been a while, so if you want to unsubscribe? No problem. Click the unsubscribe button at the bottom of the email. We still love you.

Now into the good stuff. My socials for the past month were a stream of AI hype and the JavaScript debate about signals. Whatever they are, at this point, I am afraid to ask. However, there has been so much excellent API content floating around. Don't worry if you missed it; that is what newsletters are for, keeping you updated.

I hope you enjoy this week's issue.

All the best 

Alexander

## The latest

### [JSON Schema: Another Breaking Change](https://json-schema.org/blog/posts/the-last-breaking-change)

The well-loved JSON Schema has introduced a breaking change to their next release as they move towards a stable specification. Sometimes you have to break things to improve them, and that's ok.

### [Build as a monolith and deploy as microservices](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/03/introducing-service-weaver-framework-for-writing-distributed-applications.html)

Google released a new open-source framework for building distributed applications called Service Weaver. The cool part is you can make it as a monolith and then deploy it as microservices. Service Weaver also helps with service-to-service communication complexities so you can focus on creating business logic, not networking. We can save the conversation about whether microservices are good for another time ðŸ˜‰.

### [Design and Build Great Web APIs](https://pragprog.com/titles/maapis/design-and-build-great-web-apis/)

I would be amiss if I didn't include this book in this week's newsletter. I have been reading this book, and it is fantastic. It is an excellent resource for anyone looking to design and build APIs. Mike Amundsen's books are pure gold; he knows his stuff.

### [OpenAPI Tooling Registry](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2023/03/08/tools-that-support-openapi-specification)

The OpenAPI initiative has put together a registry of tools that support OpenAPI. This registry covers everything from parsers to SDKs, gateways and more.
