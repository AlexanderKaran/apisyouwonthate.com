Mike is Director of Technology for [The Gymasium](http://www.thegymnasium.com), a MOOC offering free courses in software design and development skills. His background is in software development, and user experience design. When he's not pretending he knows what he's doing in front of a computer, Mike is also a musician, a cyclist, and a yogi.

He graduated from the University of the London Underground, Mornington Crescent campus, and is perhaps most well known for his groundbreaking research on the mating rituals of chemtrails, and once famously said "I don't trust anything that swims for a living."
