---

I've been working on APIs since 2005, and since 2019 I'm running
'Bad Gateway', an API agency in Toronto.

Check out some of my projects:

* [My blog](https://evertpot.com/)
* [Ketting](https://github.com/evert/ketting) - A generic Hypermedia client for Javascript
* [Curveball](https://github.com/curveball) - A modern microframework for building APIs with Node.js
