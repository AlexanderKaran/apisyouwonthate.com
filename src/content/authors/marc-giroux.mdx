I work at GitHub on the Ecosystem API team, trying to make both the life of our integrators and our own engineers better by helping build well designed APIs and providing best practices and tools internally.

Over the past few years my focus has been on GraphQL. I love tools and specifications that allow API developers to provide better experiences.
