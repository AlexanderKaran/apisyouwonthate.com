title: Automating API Style Guides
type: video
---

API Governance and API Design Reviews are a hot topic over the last few years,
but it's been an incredibly manual process until now.

Tools like [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral) give governance teams the ability to write API style guides
in a format more useful than a Word document or Wiki entry, and mean API
designers get feedback early: speeding up design reviews, governance, and making
your APIs more consistent!
