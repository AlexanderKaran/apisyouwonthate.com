Mini conference talk covering HTTP caching, mostly caching client responses via HTTP middleware to skip making requests the client already has fresh answers to, then using conditional validation to check if things have changed.

Conditional validation is one of the least understood but most powerful features for HTTP, but it's simple when you get the hang of it!

Make your applications quicker, save mangling application servers when you don't need to, and we'll even throw in some hints towards network caching to really help iron out stampeding herds.
