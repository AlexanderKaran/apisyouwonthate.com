Is your API working right now?

You might be confident, but things might not be as ok as you hope!

It can be a tough question to answer. A lot of monitoring tools are out there, like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) which can track all sorts of metrics, but that assumes metrics are being sent to it which let you know there’s a problem. Maybe [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com/) can track response times, and [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) can track exceptions, but there could be a lot of things relating to “application health” which do not fall into those categories.

Application health is an important difference to test suite success. Test suites confirm that the code you’ve pointed some tests at work with the environment variables in your test suite, but that doesn’t mean that same code will work with different environment variables.

Some people confuse application health with “server health”, but that is rather different. Server health is knowing things like the amount of disk space or memory that your server has left, and reporting that the database is running perfectly. This is easily solved with tools like [collectd](https://collectd.org/), which can shuffle these metrics back to collectors like Prometheus. Unfortunately that doesn’t mean your application knows how to talk to that perfectly functioning database.

To get a current snapshot of the health of a specific application (even if its only the specific instance you happen to get routed to when you make that HTTP request), there are a lot of tools which help you expose some sort of “health check endpoint”. Every programming language seems to have a prominent tool for doing this, at a totally different endpoint, with a totally different payload.

*   Ruby: [OkComputer](https://github.com/sportngin/okcomputer) runs on `/okcomputer` with a mega-response
*   Python: [health-check](https://pypi.org/project/health-check/) has a bunch of various `/api/health/database` endpoints
*   Java/Spring Boot: [Actuator](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-actuators) adds `/health`, `/metrics`, and `/info`

Whatever language/framework you use, one of these tools is probably a good idea.

As somebody working at a company with a whole bunch of languages being used, I still somehow have delusions of having consistency across those various systems. Luckily there is a [draft RFC HTTP response format for health checks](https://inadarei.github.io/rfc-healthcheck/), which anyone can conform to right now.

_Sure draft RFCs are not final RFCs, but if people do not implement the drafts, they never become final RFCs. Check out_ [_Sunset_](https://blog.apisyouwonthate.com/surviving-deprecations-to-resources-and-properties-on-other-apis-9711e7def610) _for another important draft RFC._

[**Surviving Deprecations to Resources and Properties on Other APIs**
_Deprecation, is the art of telling people to stop using that thing, because that thing is probably going away at some…_blog.apisyouwonthate.com](https://blog.apisyouwonthate.com/surviving-deprecations-to-resources-and-properties-on-other-apis-9711e7def610 "https://blog.apisyouwonthate.com/surviving-deprecations-to-resources-and-properties-on-other-apis-9711e7def610")[](https://blog.apisyouwonthate.com/surviving-deprecations-to-resources-and-properties-on-other-apis-9711e7def610)

Each of those tools need to start supporting “formats”, and there should be a “legacy” format (whatever they currently have), and a “RFC HealthCheck” format which supports this draft RFC.

Using these tools has allowed departments at WeWork to build internal “Status Dashboards” that let support staff have great insight into the status of various applications. Especially if the health checks go beyond the standard “database” and “cache” checks, and start reporting circuit breaker statuses for other services.

#### Kubernetes Cares about Application Health

Above we talked about making a health endpoint that we could hit up for a status page or whatever, but how about if we knew that health status _before_ we deployed?

If you happen to be using Kubernetes, you can use HTTP-based [readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/), which make sure that application doesn’t make it into rotation in the load balancer until it is ready. After it becomes ready, if at any point in the future it seems to be suffering, Kubernetes will remove it from the load balancer automatically!

Kubernetes pods have a whole [lifecycle](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/), but basically pods are created, and remain as “pending” until they are “ready”. Once a pod the pod is considered “ready” it will be placed in the load balancer for that service, and it will start accepting traffic. When a new pod is placed into the load balancer, a corresponding pod for that service from a previous release will be removed. If a service has multiple pods it will do this one at a time, and as each new pod becomes ready a corresponding old one will be removed until the new release is complete.

Exactly how Kubernetes determines a pod to be ready depends on how the readiness probe was configured the [your Helm chart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CELGSyDLOQ0D9TFgbVA19eKKzlUbU_ynowd40ilomKQ/edit#), specifically in `<yourapp>-chart/templates/<service>-deployment.yaml`

spec:
  containers:
    - name: yourapp-web
  ports:
    - containerPort: {{ .Values.service.targetPort }}
      name: {{ lower .Values.service.targetProtocol }}
      protocol: TCP
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      scheme: {{ upper .Values.service.targetProtocol }}
      path: /health
      port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  timeoutSeconds: 2

This is telling Kubernetes to wait 5 seconds, then try and send a HTTP GET request to `/health`. If that endpoint returns a HTTP response code is between 200 and 399 then the pod is considered ready. If it returns any other status, then it will stay as “pending”, and another probe will be send later on.

Another type of probe is “liveness”. Once a pod has been defined as ready, it is then live, until a liveness check decides it is not live. This could mean the server crashed, the pod ran out of memory, or any one of many other things that can cause code to fail. A liveness probe works just the same as a readiness probe, and accepts the same configuration.

### Different Types of Probe

There are three different types of probe that can be used by Kubernetes:

#### tcpSocket

A TCP probe just checks that a process is listening on that port and accepting TCP connections, it does not confirm that whatever is listening (and its related dependencies) are fully booted. If a pod is considered ready prematurely it will replace a fully functioning pod from the previous release with a pod that is not yet ready for traffic. For this reason, a TCP probe should only be used for processes that do not start listening until initialization is complete.

#### httpGet

A HTTP probe is preferable for any HTTP-based applications, like a REST API, web UI, etc. If the application has a fully functioning web server, and the health endpoint is written to check the important dependencies are available to it, then we should have strong confidence the pod is ready.

The HTTP response status code should be between 200 and 399, and bonus points for HTTP applications that return a body that conforms to [RFC Draft: Health Check](https://inadarei.github.io/rfc-healthcheck/).

#### exec

Exec is a fantastic “other” option, which does not rely on TCP or HTTP at all. For example, Redis could be implemented as a TCP check, but it is so much better handled with an `exec` probe:

livenessProbe:
  exec:
    command: \["redis-cli", "ping"\]
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  exec:
    command: \["redis-cli", "ping"\]
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 5

If the `redis-cli ping` command fails, it will not be ready, or stop it from being live, and that has a lot more intelligence built in than a simple TCP check.

This is also useful for gRPC APIs. Seeing as they are not pure HTTP, they need special handling. For a long time there were three fairly awful choices:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4D_OG4hOR2Ki6OF7.png)

1.  httpGet means you have to set up a HTTP/1.1 bridge for an otherwise HTTP/2-only app
2.  tcpSocket means you might have traffic directed to a pod which is not yet truly ready, meaning you blue/green deployments are looking a bit brown
3.  You built some special snowflake exec based checking, which involves special documentation and monitoring

Since gRPC v1.15 there is a [standardized approach to exec health checks!](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/10/01/health-checking-grpc-servers-on-kubernetes/)

This serves as a warning that using non-standard API implementations means you need non-standard solutions. gRPC only got a standard for doing this recently, and implementing it needs awkward treatment in Kubernetes.

If you use GraphQL there still isn’t really a plan. Googling “graphql health checks” somebody is just tweeting about maybe automating a simple query.

Standards are great folks!

When I write about [the differences between REST and Other Implementations™](https://blog.apisyouwonthate.com/picking-the-right-api-paradigm-d476f1a622e8) and say things like “standard HTTP things do not work for GraphQL/gRPC”, this is the sort of thing being discussed. Over time implementation specific solutions are created and there are various workarounds floating about, but ignoring the conventions of HTTP can lead to complications. If you understand the pros and cons, and are willing to get involved with all that, then fair enough. But don’t forget about this non-standardness when deciding between various paradigms or implementations!
