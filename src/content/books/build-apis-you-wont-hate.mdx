API development is increasingly common for server-side developers thanks to the
rise of front-end JavaScript frameworks, iPhone applications, and API-centric
architectures. It might seem like grabbing stuff from a data source and shoving
it out as JSON would be easy, but surviving changes in business logic, database
schema updates, new features, or deprecated endpoints can be a nightmare.

After finding many of the existing resources for API development to be lacking,
Phil learned a lot of things the hard way through years of trial and error. This
book aims to condense that experience, taking examples and explanations further
than the trivial apples and pears nonsense tutorials often provide.

Phil worked primarily as an API developer for the last three years. One horror
was managing an API built in FuelPHP by a freelancer at the million dollar
startup he joined. It was utilizing a then deprecated ORM which had been hacked
to death by the previous developer, so took the time to delete that mess and
build the next version in Laravel, leveraging it's simple routing, database
migrations, schema, seeding, etc. When the following major version of the API
was built no rewrite was required, and both managed to live side-by-side on the
same "API" servers.

By passing on some best practices and general good advice you can hit the ground
running with API development, combined with some horror stories and how they
were overcome/avoided/averted. This book will discuss the theory of designing
and building APIs in any language or framework, with this theory applied in
PHP-based examples.

Some of the more advanced topics covered here are endpoint testing, embedding
data objects in a consistent and scalable manner, paginating responses
(including embedded objects) and hypermedia "HATEOAS" controls.
