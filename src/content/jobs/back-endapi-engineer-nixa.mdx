They are a team of 6 people today working remotely across London, Paris, Wales and Berlin - and they just landed a big funding round from Europe's leading investors (early investors in Revolut, MySQL, TransferWise and UiPath). This is a unique chance to join a startup in it's early phase and get the chance to influence the back-end, API and, product development from scratch.
